      <p>Good Day,<br/>
      I'm Cherry Joy Pepito, and I draw to express myself rather than to impress people's eyes.<br/>
      I appreciate and am quite interested in everything that are related to arts, particularly drawing.<br/>
      I can express my individuality and emotions through it. In our nasty society, we can't help<br/>
      but to be stressed about things as individuals. One of my coping mechanisms is to engage in activities<br/>
      that I genuinely love and passionate about. Drawing, like nearly any other kind of art, allows me<br/>
      to express emotions that words cannot describe.<br/><br/>
      Further more, the biggest reward I could ever give to myself is the opportunity to recharge after<br/>
      a long day. Art gives me freedom: freedom to think endlessly without being judged, freedom to improve<br/>
      my mental health and state, and freedom to be who I am. I wouldn't love to imagine a life without my<br/>
      graphite pencil and sketchpad. For me, this aren't only just things but rather I consider these stuffs<br/>
      as my emotion interpreters. <br/>
